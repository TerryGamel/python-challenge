Module 3 challenge for Data Analytics

The PyBank application can be found at pybank\main.py
The output of that application is at pybank\analysis\output_data.txt

The PyPoll application can be found at pypoll\main.py
The output of that application is at pypoll\analysis\output_data.txt

For both applications, I utilized the open csvfile syntax provided by the instructor in our 
Data Analytics class lessons.  

Both utilized floating point calculations pulled from
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/455612/limiting-floats-to-two-decimal-points

Both utilized file open and f.write from https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_file_write.asp
and "\n" from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2918362/writing-string-to-a-file-on-a-new-line-every-time

The pypoll application additionally borrowed the idea of using the set method to pull a unique set of items from a list from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-get-unique-values-list/

The pypoll application also found syntax for how to sort the resulting set-turned-list at
